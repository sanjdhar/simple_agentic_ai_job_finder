### Search Type Details

| Search Type      | Best For                      | Output Files                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Standard         | General job searching         | `job-results-2.json`, `new-job-analysis-2.md` |
| Salary Focused   | Salary is primary concern     | `salary-focused-results.md`                   |
| Company Targeted | Preferred companies           | `company-targeted-results.md`                 |
| Entry Level      | New graduates/career changers | `entry-level-results.md`                      |
| Quick            | Urgent job searching          | `quick-search-results.md`                     |
| Full             | Comprehensive with networking | All files + `new-job-post-2.md`               |

## üìÅ Output Files

Results are saved in the `./job-posts/` directory:

- **JSON files**: Structured job data for further processing
- **Markdown files**: Human-readable analysis and recommendations
- **Analysis files**: Career guidance and market insights
- **Message files**: LinkedIn messages and cold emails

### Multi-Agent Workflow

The system uses a collaborative approach where agents build upon each other's work:

1. **JobSearchAgent** writes initial job search results to files
2. **AnalysisAgent** reads these results using `docs_tool` and `file_tool` to provide comprehensive analysis
3. **MessageWriterAgent** accesses the job data to create personalized outreach messages

This workflow ensures that each agent has access to the complete context of previous searches and analyses, enabling more intelligent and comprehensive results.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**:

   - Verify your `.env` file has correct API keys
   - Check API key permissions and quotas

2. **Rate Limiting**:

   - The tool automatically retries with delays
   - Consider upgrading your SerpAPI plan for higher limits

3. **No Results Found**:

   - Try broader search terms
   - Check if your location preference is too restrictive
   - Verify your required skills aren't too specific

4. **Import Errors**:

   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version compatibility

5. **File Access Issues**:
   - Ensure the `./job-posts/` directory exists and is writable
   - Check file permissions if agents can't read previous results
   - Verify that search results are being written to the output directory

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting `verbose=True` in crew configurations.

### Understanding Agent Collaboration

The system uses file-based communication between agents:

- If **AnalysisAgent** reports "No previous results found", ensure JobSearchAgent completed successfully
- If **MessageWriterAgent** can't create personalized messages, check that job search results exist in `./job-posts/`
- The `docs_tool` and `file_tool` are essential for agent collaboration - don't remove them

## üîÑ How the Multi-Agent System Works

### Agent Collaboration Flow

1. **Search Phase**: JobSearchAgent performs job searches and saves results to `./job-posts/`
2. **Analysis Phase**: AnalysisAgent reads the search results using file tools and provides strategic insights
3. **Outreach Phase**: MessageWriterAgent accesses job data to create personalized LinkedIn messages and emails

### File-Based Communication

- **docs_tool**: Reads all markdown files from the job-posts directory for comprehensive analysis
- **file_tool**: Accesses specific files when agents need detailed information
- **Output Files**: Serve as the communication medium between agents

This architecture ensures each agent builds upon previous work, creating a comprehensive job search experience.
